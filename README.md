# An open-source system for pupillometric tracking in head-fixed mice

Designed by members of the Rodriguez-Romaguera Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this running wheel for head-fixed mice allows researchers to capture pupil dynamics and body kinematics. Our system relies on two sperate cameras, an infared camera placed at eye-level to capture pupil size and an aerial monochrome camera to record body kinematics. Additionally, our system is capable of capturing  locomotion, or the mouse's movement across time, as our wheel system is attatched to a mounted rotary encoder.

### **Behavioral Data Collected**:
- IR Camera → Pupil Dynamics (Dilation and Constriction)
- Monochrome Camera → Body Kinematics (Body and Tail Movement)
- Rotary Encoder → Locotion (Speed and Acceleration)

### **Custom Arduino Printed Circuit Board Shield**:
Our system is driven and controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller board, with a custom printed circuit board (PCB) shield with build in resistance, interactive feedback LEDs, real-time clock compatibility, and screw hole terminals. The PCB shield expands the capabilities of the microcontroller board and allows for greater stability than a conventional solderless circuit board. 

### **Required Software and Applications**:
- MATLAB R2022a 
- Arduino IDE 
- SpinView 
- DeepLabCuts
