# An open-source system for pupillometric tracking in head-fixed mice

Designed by members of the Rodriguez-Romaguera Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this running wheel for head-fixed mice allows researchers to capture pupil dynamics, locomotion, and body kinematics aross time. Our system relies on two sperate cameras, an infared camera placed at eye-level to capture pupil size and an aerial monochrome camera to record body kinematics. Additionally, we attached our wheel system to a mounted rotary encoder in order to measure the mouse's movement over the course of the experiment.
